### Methods
depth - determine the depth of a given node

find - search for a node containing a given value

height - determine the height of a given node

inOrder - traverse the tree depth-first, in order

insert - insert a new node containing the given value

isBalanced - determine if the tree is balanced or not

levelOrder - traverse the tree in breadth-first level order

postOrder - traverse the tree depth-first, post order

preOrder - traverse the tree depth-first. pre order

prettyPrint - display the tree prettily (provided by The Odin Project)

rebalance - turn an unbalanced tree into a balanced one

remove - delete a particular node
